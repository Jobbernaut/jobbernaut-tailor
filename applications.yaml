    Finance is the engine of the global economy. It decides which ideas get built, which companies rise, and how resources are allocated. Yet it runs on slow tools and outdated technology.

    Our mission is to transform finance. We’re building the AI analyst that makes every banker, investor, and executive smarter, faster, and more creative. When finance works better, capital flows more efficiently, innovation accelerates, and progress compounds across the entire economy. We’re not building generic AI.

    Strong coding fundamentals, with an understanding of algorithms, data structures, and design patterns

    Experience developing backend systems in Java, Typescript, Python, Rust or similar languages/frameworks (via projects, internships, or OSS)

    Comfort working with Git, unit testing, CI/CD, and observability tools; detail-oriented with a bias toward action

    Strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset; you enjoy being part of a team

    Bonus

    Hands-on LLM/retrieval projects or meaningful OSS/internship experience

    Experience with React and building highly polished UIs

    Experience with Kubernetes, terraform, or cloud infrastructure

    Experience with ETL or data processing pipelines at scale

    Who You Are
    You thrive in fast-paced environments. You are high-intensity and care a lot about what you do, and you're ecstatic to work at a startup.

    You are ambitious. You have fun solving problems that others think are impossible.

    You are curious. You find joy in learning about AI, technology, and finance.

    You are an owner. You are autonomous, self-directed, and comfortable working with ambiguity.

    You are collaborative, organized, thoughtful, and kind.

    Why Join Rogo?
    Exceptional traction: strong PMF with the world's largest investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms.

    World-class team: we take talent density seriously. We like working with incredibly smart, driven people.

    Velocity: we work fast, which means you learn a lot and constantly take on more.

    Frontier technology: we're developing cutting-edge AI systems, pushing the boundaries of reinforcement learning and published research, redefining what's possible, and inventing the future.

    Compensation
    San Francisco Bay Area
    $120K – $150K • Offers Equity
    Overview
    Application
    Software Engineering, New Grad – Eventual (San Francisco, CA)

    About Eventual
    Eventual enables developers to build the AI systems of the future by making multi-modal data and models work together seamlessly. Every breakthrough AI application—from foundation models to autonomous vehicles relies on processing massive volumes of images, video, and complex data. But today’s data platforms (like Databricks and Snowflake) were built for spreadsheet-like analytics, not the petabytes of multimodal data that power AI.

    Eventual was founded in 2022 to change that. Our mission is to make working with any kind of data—images, video, audio, text—as intuitive as working with tables, and powerful enough to scale to production workloads. Our open-source engine, Daft, is purpose-built for real-world AI systems: coordinating with external APIs, managing GPU clusters, and handling failures that traditional engines can’t.

    Daft already powers critical workloads at companies like Amazon, Mobileye, Together AI, and CloudKitchens. Backed by Y Combinator, Caffeinated Capital, Array.vc, and top angels from the co-founders of Databricks and Perplexity, we’re just getting started—and we’d love for you to be part of it.

    Please note: This is a full time job is based in our San Francisco office (Mission District). We value in-person collaboration and ask our engineers to be in the office at least 4 days a week.


    Your Role

    As a Software Engineering New Grad, you’ll work alongside our engineers to contribute to Eventual’s core products and open-source engine. You’ll gain hands-on experience building distributed data systems and products, while learning how to design, implement, and test features that support real-world AI and ML workloads.

    You’ll get mentorship from our team (ex-Databricks, AWS, Nvidia, Tesla, GitHub Copilot, Pinecone) and the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that reach production.


    Key Responsibilities
    Contribute to building features in Eventual’s distributed query engine.

    Work on developing Eventual’s cloud service.

    Write clean, maintainable code with guidance from senior engineers.

    Collaborate with the team to design and implement solutions for real-world data challenges.

    Assist with testing, debugging, and documenting core system components.


    What We Look For
    Within 1 year of graduating from University

    Strong programming skills in Python and/or Rust.

    Interest in distributed systems, databases, or data infrastructure.

    Familiarity with cloud technologies (AWS, GCP, or Azure) is a plus.

    Excitement to learn from a fast-paced startup environment and contribute to real-world systems.

    Overview
    Application
    OffDeal is the world’s first AI-native investment bank for small businesses. Instead of selling AI to Goldman Sachs, we’re building what Goldman itself would have looked like if it launched in 2025.

    Wall Street's playbook works well, but only for billion-dollar deals - it breaks where most businesses actually exist. Traditional firms run oversized teams on outdated software, making smaller M&A transactions uneconomical. This leaves millions of small business owners with nowhere to turn for the most important sale of their lives… Until now.

    Our engineers built software to automate 80%+ of analyst work with AI, so our in-house bankers can focus where it counts - on earning owners’ trust and closing deals.

    We recently closed a $12M Series A ($17M in total funding) from Radical Ventures and Y Combinator and are scaling really fast. In less than a year, our team has already launched over 30 sell-side M&A transactions and has delivered numerous life-changing exits to our clients - and we’re just getting started.

    The Role

    Your work will directly impact how $10 trillion worth of small businesses change hands over the coming decade.

    What You'll Do

    Collaborate with our in-house investment bankers to own 0 to 1 projects, from ideation to deployment

    Build across the entire stack, in our 100% TypeScript (i.e. ReactJS + NodeJS) codebase

    Work with the latest AI tech, from on our in-house AI agents to complex recommendation and search algorithms
