  job_description: 'About Us: Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s
    work. In today''s world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for
    teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar,
    and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users,
    from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion
    for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

    In-person collaboration is essential to Notion''s culture. We require all team
    members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor
    Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays. This
    internship will take place from Jan 26 - Apr 17 and you will need to be able to
    work out of our NY or SF office during this time.

    About The Role: Mobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a
    desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create
    their own tools, we''ll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive
    mobile experience: that''s our guiding light, and we need Android engineers to
    make it a reality.

    During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help
    guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects.
    These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From
    product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities
    available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked
    on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.

    What You''ll Achieve: Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.

    You''ll collaborate with the team to strategize, mold, and develop innovative
    features for our Android application.

    At our core, we prioritize crafting top-tier applications. Your role could involve
    enhancing the Android app''s performance, reliability, and overall refinement.
    Additionally, you''ll have the opportunity to optimize aspects of the app within
    the web stack.

    Qualifications: Pursuing a bachelor''s or master’s degree in computer science,
    engineering, or another related field. Must graduate before December 2026.

    Previous mobile internship experience.

    Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Kotlin,
    Java, Typescript, Node.js, Swift, Go, Python, or Rust.

    You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving
    them.

    You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced,
    dynamic environment.

    This internship will take place from Jan - Apr and you will need to be able to
    work out of our SF or NY office during this time.

    Skills You''ll Need to Bring: Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving
    starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose
    tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates.
    You''re comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.

    For a android internship: You have a passion for Android development and are excited
    to work on large scale challenges with cutting-edge technology.

    Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you''re building,
    and how it shapes real people''s lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility
    for our impact—good and bad.

    Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages
    are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you''re not ideological and can
    learn new technologies as you go.

    Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you''re
    explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements,
    you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.

    Team player: For you, work isn''t a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally
    to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping
    others to do the same.

    Nice to Haves: You''re proficient with any part of our technology stack: Kotlin,
    Jetpack Compose, Android SDK, Dagger, Swift, React, TypeScript, Postgres.

    You''ve heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan
    Kay, and others—and understand why we''re big fans of their work.

    You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

    Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from
    a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it''s the right thing to do, but
    because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm
