  job_title: Full-Stack Software Engineer
  company_name: Wanderlog
  status: processed
  job_description: ' Warning: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately,
    we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.

    Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world
    better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built
    starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on
    iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden
    fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions,
    restaurants, etc.), and more.

    Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant
    at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and
    product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built
    successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals)
    with products people love before starting Wanderlog.

    We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 6, including 5 engineers
    hailing from Yale, University of Toronto, UCLA, and more; and 1 designer. We’re
    a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.

    We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans;
    or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the
    team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy,
    and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of
    the world.

    What you’ll do: As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the
    product. You’ll be expected to:

    Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript):
    modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)

    Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth.
    You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!

    Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources
    around the web.

    Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed
    (Typescript) and tested.

    Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.

    Review code written by other engineers.

    Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost
    in time and future technical debt.

    This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.

    What you might work on: New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make
    finding a place to stay easier.

    AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the
    places they mention.

    Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android
    phones.

    A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit,
    airfares, and hotels.

    Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get
    more friends to join them.

    A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve
    been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.

    You may be a good fit if you: Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React
    and/or React Native.

    Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care
    about the people who use them.

    Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We
    quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously
    use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.

    Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking
    to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.

    Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.

    What’s it like to work here? We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s
    something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s
    work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma,
    and building and shipping them continuously.

    Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating
    teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and
    how we build it.

    We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates
    us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the
    goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team
    in person.

    Our hiring process We’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming
    challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a
    coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred
    language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual
    onsite via video call.

    Founders Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles,
    Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling
    down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support
    teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.

    Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally
    Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the
    team.

    Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York
    Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix
    (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been
    working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier! '

  job_description: ' About the role We’re looking for a Full-Stack Software Engineer
    (New Grad) with experience building AI applications to join our team in the San
    Francisco Bay Area. As a new grad we don’t expect you to have much experience,
    but you must have at least one public project on GitHub that you built (not a
    fork). This can be a hackathon project, side project, or something you just built
    for fun. The most important thing is that you’ve built an app end-to-end (ideally
    an AI application that has been used by people). When applying, please include
    a link to a project you’ve built.

    At StarSling we''re focused on making all the annoying tasks outside of your code
    editor fully agentic; everything from deployment to performance, incidents, and
    bugs. We’re building Cursor for DevOps (more details here).

    You''ll be working directly with me (Daniel). Before StarSling, I was the Engineering
    Manager at Netflix working on the most used internal tool across all of Netflix’s
    3K+ engineers and tens of thousands of microservices — an internal developer portal
    called Netflix Console. Earlier in my career I was an engineer on Facebook’s AI
    Camera team and helped build the mobile computer vision library that currently
    powers camera effects for 100M+ DAUs across IG, FB, and WhatsApp. I’m obsessed
    with helping every engineer be more productive.

    You’ll also be working directly with my co-founder Yonas. Before StarSling, Yonas
    was the Founder & CEO of StackShare, a developer community used by over 40 million
    developers. He raised $12M as a first-time founder and did founder sales to get
    them to just under $1M ARR with their enterprise product before selling the company
    last year. He’s obsessed with creating product experiences that developers love
    and building community.

    💻 What You’ll Own Event-driven backend: Architect our Node.js / Next.js / TypeScript
    and Supabase stack. Design schemas, event flows and ingest dev tools webhooks
    to power a real-time personalized engineering portal. LLM Agentic Workflows: Build
    a system of agents — MCP, tool use, memory, retry logic, context updates, feedback
    mechanisms. Agent Experience (AX): Create intuitive product interfaces for human-agent
    interactions. Explore and iterate with engineers to find the right interaction
    paradigm to productivity work with a digital co-pilot. System Design & Technical
    Strategy: Work directly with me to determine the best technical path that balances
    moving fast and scaling to many customers using different dev tools. Determine
    how we integrate and support the open-source community. ✅ This IS for you if You’re
    a full-stack 0-to-1 builder who has shipped a complete application. You have a
    genuine curiosity about agentic product experiences and are excited about understanding
    the impact of AI on engineering users. You’re a previous founder or founding engineer.
    You have built something from scratch that people use or pay for. You’re unusually
    obsessed with hard problems. Your current skills or even what you''ve done before
    is less important than your ability to go all-in and accomplish anything that
    you set your mind to. You’re comfortable with ambiguity and adapting to dynamic
    priorities. You need to have good judgement to know when to let little fires burn
    and when to immediately jump in. You have excellent communication and candor.
    You’ll be communicating directly with engineers and collaborating with us on key
    decisions. You care about helping swamped engineers fight through the schlep of
    software development. If that''s not an exciting mission for you, it will be hard
    to stay motivated through the inevitable highs and lows. You have grit and perseverance.
    You should accustomed to picking between hard options and pushing through it.
    ❌ This IS NOT for you if You’re not based in The Bay Area (we’ll be a team of
    four if you join so we’ll be sitting next to each other everyday) You’re not willing
    to work six days per week (we take Sundays off) You’re not excited about using
    codegen tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc. You’re not comfortable
    deleting 80%-90% of the code that you write. You’re not comfortable with ambiguity
    and rapid context-switching. You don’t like candor- receiving and giving direct,
    honest feedback. You need a well defined structure or career ladder. 🌍 The Opportunity
    Work alongside two experienced co-founders - one who built and sold a dev tools
    startup and one who led the engineering effort to create the same product we’re
    creating at scale Get experience across the startup stack - you’ll be doing customer
    support, bug squashing, user interviews, events, and everything else along with
    writing code Be one of the first employees of the next dev tools category leader

  job_description: 'About Us: Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s
    work. In today''s world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for
    teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar,
    and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users,

    for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.

    internship will take place from Jan 26 - Apr 17 and you will need to be able to
    work out of our NY or SF office during this time.

    About The Role: Mobile devices have reshaped personal computing—the power of a
    desktop now fits in our pockets. By giving everyone the building blocks to create
    their own tools, we''ll solve more problems wherever we go. A delightful, intuitive
    mobile experience: that''s our guiding light, and we need Android engineers to
    make it a reality.

    During your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help
    guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects.
    These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From
    product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities
    available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked
    on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.

    What You''ll Achieve: Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.

    You''ll collaborate with the team to strategize, mold, and develop innovative
    features for our Android application.

    At our core, we prioritize crafting top-tier applications. Your role could involve
    enhancing the Android app''s performance, reliability, and overall refinement.
    Additionally, you''ll have the opportunity to optimize aspects of the app within
    the web stack.

    Qualifications: Pursuing a bachelor''s or master’s degree in computer science,
    engineering, or another related field. Must graduate before December 2026.

    Previous mobile internship experience.

    Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Kotlin,
    Java, Typescript, Node.js, Swift, Go, Python, or Rust.

    You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving
    them.

    You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced,
    dynamic environment.

    This internship will take place from Jan - Apr and you will need to be able to
    work out of our SF or NY office during this time.

    Skills You''ll Need to Bring: Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving
    starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose
    tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates.
    You''re comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.

    For a android internship: You have a passion for Android development and are excited
    to work on large scale challenges with cutting-edge technology.

    Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you''re building,
    and how it shapes real people''s lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility
    for our impact—good and bad.

    Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages
    are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you''re not ideological and can
    learn new technologies as you go.

    Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you''re
    explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements,
    you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.

    Team player: For you, work isn''t a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally
    to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping
    others to do the same.

    Nice to Haves: You''re proficient with any part of our technology stack: Kotlin,
    Jetpack Compose, Android SDK, Dagger, Swift, React, TypeScript, Postgres.

    You''ve heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan
    Kay, and others—and understand why we''re big fans of their work.

    You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

    Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from
    a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it''s the right thing to do, but
    because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm
    for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.
