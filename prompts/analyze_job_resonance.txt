JOB DESCRIPTION:
[JOB_DESCRIPTION]

COMPANY: [COMPANY_NAME]

Extract and return a JSON object with these fields:

1. "emotional_keywords": Array of emotionally charged words that reveal what the company values (e.g., "passionate", "innovative", "ownership", "impact", "drive", "excellence")

2. "cultural_values": Array of company culture signals and work environment descriptors (e.g., "collaborative", "fast-paced", "data-driven", "customer-obsessed", "entrepreneurial", "inclusive")

3. "hidden_requirements": Array of implicit requirements not explicitly stated in bullet points (e.g., "startup mentality", "ambiguity tolerance", "self-starter", "bias for action", "growth mindset")

4. "power_verbs": Array of action verbs from the JD to mirror in resume for consistency (e.g., "architected", "spearheaded", "optimized", "drove", "transformed", "scaled")

5. "technical_keywords": Array of ALL technical skills, tools, frameworks, and technologies mentioned for ATS optimization (e.g., "Python", "AWS", "React", "PostgreSQL", "Kubernetes", "CI/CD")

6. "underlying_anxiety": A 1-2 sentence analysis of the core problem/pain point this hire solves
   - Look BEYOND the listed responsibilities to identify the hiring manager's underlying anxiety
   - What is the #1 problem they are desperately trying to solve by making this hire?
   - Read between the lines: urgency signals, repetition of themes, scale mentions, problem keywords
   - Examples:
     * "Scaling to 10,000+ satellites requires zero-downtime deployment. Current pipeline cannot keep pace with growth trajectory."
     * "Manual processes are bleeding significant resources. Need rapid automation expertise to improve operational efficiency within tight constraints."
     * "Security vulnerabilities growing with platform scale. Need hardened systems and proactive threat mitigation before next audit cycle."
     * "Legacy codebase blocking innovation velocity. Need modernization expertise to enable team to ship features faster."
   - Focus on the PAIN, not just the responsibilities

7. "priority_proof_metrics": Array of EXACTLY 3 metric types (ordered by importance) that the hiring manager will prioritize above all else
   - These are the TYPES of impact they care about most (not specific numbers, but categories of proof)
   - Infer from: what problems are emphasized, what outcomes are mentioned, what pain points appear repeatedly
   - Examples of metric types:
     * "uptime/reliability improvements" (e.g., for mission-critical systems, aerospace, infrastructure)
     * "cost reduction/efficiency gains" (e.g., for startups, operations roles, automation-focused positions)
     * "deployment speed/velocity" (e.g., for DevOps, CI/CD, platform engineering)
     * "security hardening/vulnerability reduction" (e.g., for security-focused roles, compliance-heavy industries)
     * "scale handling/performance optimization" (e.g., for high-growth companies, distributed systems)
     * "user satisfaction/experience improvements" (e.g., for product-focused roles, customer-facing systems)
     * "team velocity/productivity increases" (e.g., for platform/tools teams, developer experience roles)
     * "data accuracy/integrity improvements" (e.g., for data engineering, analytics, ML infrastructure)
   - Order from MOST to LEAST critical (hiring manager will look for #1 first, then #2, then #3)
   - Must be EXACTLY 3 items

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Each array MUST have at least one item
- Extract ACTUAL words/phrases from the job description - do not invent
- Focus on words that reveal company culture and values
- Return ONLY valid JSON with no additional text

Example format:
```json
{
  "emotional_keywords": ["passionate", "innovative", "ownership", "impact"],
  "cultural_values": ["collaborative", "fast-paced", "data-driven"],
  "hidden_requirements": ["startup mentality", "ambiguity tolerance", "self-starter"],
  "power_verbs": ["architected", "spearheaded", "optimized", "drove"],
  "technical_keywords": ["Python", "AWS", "React", "PostgreSQL", "Docker"],
  "underlying_anxiety": "Platform struggling to scale beyond 1M users. Current architecture causing frequent outages and customer churn.",
  "priority_proof_metrics": ["uptime/reliability improvements", "scale handling/performance optimization", "deployment speed/velocity"]
}
