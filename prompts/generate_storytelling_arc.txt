3. "proof_points": Array of 2-3 specific story elements from candidate's experience that demonstrate fit. Each should be 2-3 sentences (~40-50 words each) and reference:
   - A specific achievement from the resume
   - How it aligns with job requirements
   - The emotional keywords and cultural values identified
