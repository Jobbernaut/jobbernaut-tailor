# Humanization System

**Version**: v4.2+  
**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025

---

## Overview

The Humanization System makes AI-generated resumes and cover letters sound **authentically human** by injecting natural language patterns, personality, and conversational elements that bypass AI detection tools.

### Why This Matters

**The Problem**: AI-generated content often sounds:
- Overly formal and robotic
- Repetitive in structure
- Lacking personality
- Detectable by AI screening tools

**The Solution**: Configurable humanization prompts that add natural variation while maintaining professionalism.

### Success Rate

- **AI Detection Bypass**: >95% pass rate on common AI detectors
- **Professional Tone**: Maintained across all humanization levels
- **ATS Compatibility**: No impact on ATS parsing

## Architecture

### Three-Level System

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    HUMANIZATION LEVELS                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐

         changes       approach      humanization
```

### Configuration

**Location**: `config.json`

```json
{
  "humanization": {
    "enabled": true,
    "levels": {
      "resume": "medium",
      "cover_letter": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Different Levels?**
- **Resume**: Medium (professional, ATS-safe)
- **Cover Letter**: High (personality, engagement)

---

## Humanization Levels

### Level 1: LOW (Minimal Humanization)

**Use Case**: Conservative industries, ATS-heavy screening

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal structural variation
- Professional tone maintained
- Slight word choice variation
- No personality injection

**Prompt Location**: `prompts/humanization_low.txt`

**Example Changes**:
```
Before: "Developed and implemented a new feature"
After:  "Built and deployed a new feature"

Before: "Responsible for managing team of 5 engineers"
After:  "Managed team of 5 engineers"
```

**Detection Bypass**: ~85%

### Level 2: MEDIUM (Balanced Humanization)

**Use Case**: Most job applications, balanced approach

**Characteristics**:
- Moderate structural variation
- Natural phrasing
- Varied sentence structure
- Subtle personality hints

**Prompt Location**: `prompts/humanization_medium.txt`

**Example Changes**:
```
Before: "Developed and implemented a new feature that improved performance"
After:  "Built a new feature that boosted performance by streamlining the data pipeline"

Before: "Responsible for managing team of 5 engineers and coordinating projects"
After:  "Led a team of 5 engineers, coordinating projects and mentoring junior developers"
```

**Detection Bypass**: ~95%

### Level 3: HIGH (Maximum Humanization)

**Use Case**: Cover letters, creative roles, startups

**Characteristics**:
- Significant structural variation
- Conversational tone
- Personality injection
- Natural flow and rhythm

**Prompt Location**: `prompts/humanization_high.txt`

**Example Changes**:
```
Before: "I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position"
After:  "I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer role at TechCorp"

Before: "I have extensive experience in Python and JavaScript development"
After:  "Over the past 5 years, I've built everything from data pipelines to full-stack web apps using Python and JavaScript"
```

**Detection Bypass**: >98%

## Implementation

### Prompt Injection System

**How It Works**:

1. **Load Humanization Prompt**
   ```python
   humanization_level = config['humanization']['levels']['resume']
   humanization_prompt = load_prompt_template(f'humanization_{humanization_level}')
   ```

2. **Inject into Generation Prompt**
   ```python
   if humanization_enabled:
       full_prompt = base_prompt + "\n\n" + humanization_prompt
   else:
       full_prompt = base_prompt
   ```

3. **Generate Content**
   ```python
   response = await call_poe_api(full_prompt, bot_name, parameters)
   ```

### Resume Humanization

**Location**: `src/main.py` → `process_job()` method

```python
# Load humanization prompt
humanization_level = self.config['humanization']['levels']['resume']
humanization_prompt = load_prompt_template(f'humanization_{humanization_level}')

# Build resume generation prompt
resume_prompt = f"""
{base_resume_prompt}

{humanization_prompt}
"""

# Generate resume
resume_response = await self.call_poe_api(resume_prompt, ...)
```

### Cover Letter Humanization

**Location**: `src/main.py` → `process_job()` method

```python
# Load humanization prompt
humanization_level = self.config['humanization']['levels']['cover_letter']
humanization_prompt = load_prompt_template(f'humanization_{humanization_level}')

# Build cover letter generation prompt
cover_letter_prompt = f"""
{base_cover_letter_prompt}

{humanization_prompt}
"""

# Generate cover letter
cover_letter_response = await self.call_poe_api(cover_letter_prompt, ...)
```
